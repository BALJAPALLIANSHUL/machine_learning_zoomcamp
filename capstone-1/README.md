# ML Zoomcamp 2025 – Capstone Project 1

## Problem Description
This project follows the Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2025 Capstone 1 guidelines.
The objective is to build a simple, reproducible ML model using concepts taught in the course.

## Dataset
- Source:
- Target variable:
- Features:

## EDA
Basic exploratory data analysis:
- Missing values
- Feature distributions
- Target distribution

## Model
- Algorithm: (e.g. LogisticRegression / RandomForest)
- Validation strategy: Train/Validation split
- Metric:

## Training
Model is trained using `train.py` and saved as `model.bin`.

## Prediction Service
A simple inference service using Flask/FastAPI (as taught in the course).

## Reproducibility
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Train:
```bash
python src/train.py
```

Predict:
```bash
python src/predict.py
```
